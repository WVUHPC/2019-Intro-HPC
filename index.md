A Supercomputer is a machine that highly exceeds the performance of currently available desktop computers.
A High-Performance Computing cluster is the most commonly used kind of supercomputer.
Intended to be used as a shared resource by several users, it relies on a resource manager and scheduler to optimize the overall execution of many jobs across a variety of compute nodes. This lesson will present the basics of using an HPC cluster, Unix commands, modules, submission of jobs, version control, and software containers.
