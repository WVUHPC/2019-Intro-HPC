The lesson on HPC is intended to happen connected to our cluster Spruce Knob.
However, several of the episodes are in fact independent from the cluster.

In particular the episodes for shell and editor can be done on your own machine if you have Linux on it or any other Unix-like Operating System.

The only episode where the cluster is a must, is for the modules. Everything is general enough is you have the packages on your computer for which the different episodes are based.
